## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r quakes}
datatable(quakes)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example, here is a map of earthquakes near Fiji.

```{r xyplot}
leaflet(quakes) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(lng=~long, lat=~lat)
```
