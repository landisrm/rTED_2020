## Introduction

- Distillation of some lessons I learned recently, trying to create an interactive data visualization tool for household travel surveys
- I have a lot of experience with static graphics, and taught a data visualization course at Middlebury College for years.
- I've always been very curious about interactive graphics but have not taken the time to learn Javascript
- Curious to take advantage of tools that leverage things I already know about
- Share with you some of the lessons learned, pros and cons of different tools
- Ability to effectively share data both internally and externally is a core skill
- How can we do it most efficiently?    

## Outline

- R + Markdown = RMarkdown
- flexdashboard
- crosstalk
- Shiny

# R + Markdown = RMarkdown

## R

## Markdown

This is **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language.  I like it because:

  - It is very readable
  - You can use it in [Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/office/use-markdown-formatting-in-teams-4d10bd65-55e2-4b2d-a1f3-2bebdcd2c772)
  - code is easy to distinguish: `foo`, `bar`, `baz`.

```{markdown, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

This is **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language.  I like it because:

  - It is very readable in plain text
  - You can use it in [Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/office/use-markdown-formatting-in-teams-4d10bd65-55e2-4b2d-a1f3-2bebdcd2c772)
  - code is easy to distinguish: `foo`, `bar`, `baz`.

```

FIXME: Add example

## RMarkdown

  - Combines plain text of Markdown with R code
  - Compiling replaces R code with output of R - figures, tables, text
  - Can export to HTML, PDF, Word
  - Results can use RSG branding, like this slideshow (written in RMarkdown and exported to HTML)
  - Do we have RSG CSS?

FIXME: Add example

# flexdashboard

## flexdashboard

# crosstalk

## crosstalk

  - Interactivity through shared data object
  - Very simple to set up
  - All client side.  No server
  - Limitations
    - Dataset has to be relatively small
    - Not all graphics are supported (e.g. histograms)
    - Leaflet is not well supported - have to use Plotly

# shiny

# HTS Example combining best of each
